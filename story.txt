A mother has a sick child.  Once, when she is tired, then falls asleep, Grim Reaper took a away her child. The mother recognizes that. She tries to find the Grim Reaper.	On her way, she meets the darkness god, he warned that Grim Reaper is even faster than the wind and he is so cruel he will never give back things that he takes from people.
The mother lives for another two years in mourning.  Every day she is reminded of how the Grim Reaper took away her child.  One day she walks outside and in the sky she sees what looks like the outline of the grim reaper in the clouds.  Her time has finally come.
She approaches the figure and shouts, "Why did you take my baby?" She hears a faint reply in the distance: "There is a time for everyone." Confused, she again demands, "You took my baby on that dreadful night two years ago. Give me back my baby!" The outline morphs into a sharper figure in front of her. Her eyes meet his, at last. Countless nights has she dreamt of this very moment.
